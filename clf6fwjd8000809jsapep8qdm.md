# Hi üëãthere,

# Now we are on the Day 13 task

# **(Basics of Python)**

<mark>Checkout the below link for Day 13 task:</mark>

[https://github.com/LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/master/2023/day13/tasks.md](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/master/2023/day13/tasks.md)

## What is Python?

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

* web development (server-side),
    
* software development,
    
* mathematics,
    
* system scripting.
    

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language with an elegant syntax that allows programmers to focus more on problem-solving than on syntax errors. One of the primary goals of Python Developers is to keep it fun to use. Python has become a big buzz in the field of modern software development, infrastructure management, and especially in [Data Science](https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-data-science/) and [Artificial Intelligence](https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-artificial-intelligence/). Most recently, Python has risen to the top 3 list of the TIOBE index of language popularity. Python is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, but you must be wondering why Python has become such a hot topic in the developers‚Äô world.

## **Features of Python**

Python provides lots of features that are listed below.

##### **Easy to Learn and Use**

Python is easy to learn and use compared with other programming languages. It is a developer-friendly and high-level programming language.

##### **Interpreted Language**

Python is an interpreted language because no need for compilation. This makes debugging easy and thus suitable for beginners.

##### **Cross-platform Language**

Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, Unix and Macintosh etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language.

##### **Free and Open Source**

The Python interpreter is developed under an open-source license, making it free to install, use, and distribute.

##### **Object-Oriented Language**

Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence.

##### **GUI Programming Support**

Graphical user interfaces can be developed using Python.

##### **Integrated**

It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, JAVA etc.

### **2\. Read about different Data Types in Python.**

![Data types in Python - Computer Notes](https://ecomputernotes.com/images/Data-Types-in-Python.jpg align="left")

Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. In Python, several built-in data types can be used to store and manipulate different types of data. The most common data types in Python are:

## **Numbers:**

There are three types of numeric data types in Python: integers, floats, and complex numbers.

a = 66 integer

b = 6.14 float

c = 3 + 2j complex number

## **Strings:**

A string is a sequence of characters, enclosed in quotes (either single or double quotes).

a = ‚ÄòHello, python!‚Äô single quotes

b = ‚ÄúFrom today onward I am learning python.‚Äù double quotes

## **Boolean:**

A Boolean data type is a binary data type that can have only two values, True or False.

a = True

b = False

## **Tuples:**

A tuple is similar to a list, but it is immutable, meaning that its elements cannot be changed once it is created.

random\_tuple = (16, ‚ÄòMango‚Äô, 2.14, True)

## **Lists:**

A list is a collection of ordered and mutable elements that can be of different data types.

random\_list = \[16, ‚Äòpython‚Äô, 2.14, True\]

## **Sets:**

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.

unorder\_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}

## **Dictionaries:**

A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value.

unordered\_dict = {‚Äòname‚Äô: ‚Äòpython‚Äô, ‚Äòage‚Äô: 1991, ‚Äòplace‚Äô: ‚ÄòNetherlands‚Äô}
