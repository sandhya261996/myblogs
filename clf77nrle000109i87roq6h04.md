# Hi üëãthere,

# Now we are on the Day 14 task

# **Basics of Python(Python Data Types and Data Structures)**

<mark>Checkout the below link for Day 14 task:</mark>

# **Data Types**

* Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.
    
* Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instances (objects) of these classes.
    
* Python has the following data types built-in by default: Numeric(Integer, complex, float), Sequential(string,lists, tuples), Boolean, Set, Dictionaries, etc
    

# **Data Structures**

Data Structures are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending on the situation. Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. Python helps to learn the fundamental of these data structures more simply as compared to other programming languages.

* Lists Python Lists are just like arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type
    
* Tuple Python Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list but Tuples are immutable i.e. the elements in the tuple cannot be added or removed once created. Just like a List, a Tuple can also contain elements of various types.
    
* Dictionary Python dictionary is like hash tables in any other language with the time complexity of O(1). It is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, a Dictionary holds the key: value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized
    

# **Tasks**

1. Give the Difference between List, Tuple,set and dictionary. Do Handson and put screenshots as per your understanding.

3\. Write a program to add `Digital Ocean` to the list of cloud\_providers and sort the list in alphabetical order.
